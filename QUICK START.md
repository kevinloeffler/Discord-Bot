# Quick Start

### Run Script
There are two options to use this bot on your discord server:

1. Upload this script to a web-server and run it from there. This guaranties that it will be available as long as the server is online. You can use Heroku's free plan and connect it to your git repository, ensuring that it is always up to date. <br> https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/discord-py/hosting-a-discord-bot-for-free/

2. Run it on your local computer. This means that if your computer is turned off or the script is not running, users on your discord channel can't use the bot.

### Debugging
For debugging purposes, the error message method is commented out so that errors appear in the console. Before you run the script make sure to remove the comment so that your users understand when an error happened.
